    <h2> Early Life and Education</h2>
    Ryan Thomas Gosling was born on November 12, 1980, at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario, the son of Thomas Ray Gosling, 
    a travelling salesman for a paper mill, and Donna, a secretary. Both of his parents are of part French Canadian descent, 
    along with some German, English, Scottish, and Irish. He and his family were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
    Saints, and Gosling has said that the religion influenced every aspect of their lives.[9] Because of his father's work, they "moved 
    around a lot" and Gosling lived in both Cornwall, Ontario and Burlington, Ontario.[11] His parents divorced when he was 13, and 
    he and his older sister Mandi lived with their mother, an experience Gosling has credited with programming him "to think like a girl". <br>
    <br>
    Gosling was educated at Gladstone Public School, Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School and Lester B. Pearson High School.
     As a child, he watched Dick Tracy and was inspired to become an actor. He "hated" being a child, he was bullied in 
    elementary school, and had no friends until he was "14 or 15". In grade one, having been heavily influenced by the 
    action film First Blood, he took steak knives to school and threw them at other children during recess. This incident led to a 
    suspension. He was unable to read, and was evaluated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but was not 
    diagnosed with it and, contrary to false reports, never took medication. His mother left her job and home-schooled him for a 
    year. He has said homeschooling gave him "a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost". Gosling performed in front of 
    audiences from an early age, encouraged by his sister being a performer. He and his sister sang together at weddings; he 
    performed with Elvis Perry, his uncle's Elvis Presley tribute act, and was involved with a local ballet company.[26] Performing 
    boosted his self-confidence as it was the only thing for which he received praise. He developed an idiosyncratic accent because, 
    as a child, he thought having a Canadian accent did not sound "tough". He began to model his accent on that of Marlon Brando.[27] 
    Gosling dropped out of high school at age 17 to focus on his acting career. <br>

        <h2> Acting Career</h2>
            <ul id = "Child_Actor"> <h3>1993–1999: Child Actor</h3>
                <ul>
                    In 1993, 12-year-old Gosling attended an open audition in Montreal for a revival of the 
                    Disney Channel's The Mickey Mouse Club.[24] He was given a two-year contract as a mouseketeer 
                    and moved to Orlando, Florida.[28] He appeared on-screen infrequently because other children were 
                    considered more talented.[29] Nonetheless, he has described the job as the greatest two years of 
                    his life.[28] Fellow cast members included Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Justin Timberlake. 
                    Gosling has credited the experience with instilling in him "this great sense of focus."[30] He became 
                    particularly close friends with Timberlake and they lived together for six months during the second year 
                    of the show. Timberlake's mother became Gosling's legal guardian after his mother returned to Canada for 
                    work reasons.[31] Gosling has said that even though he and Timberlake talk infrequently, they are still 
                    supportive of each other. <br>
                    <br>

                    Following the show's cancellation in 1995, Gosling returned to Canada, where he continued to 
                    appear in family entertainment television series, including Are You Afraid of the Dark? (1995)[32] 
                    and Goosebumps (1996),[32] and starred in Breaker High (1997–98) as Sean Hanlon.[32] At age eighteen, 
                    he moved to New Zealand to film the Fox Kids adventure series Young Hercules (1998–1999) as the title 
                    character.[32] He later said that he initially enjoyed working on the series, but began to care too much 
                    about the show, so it was no longer fun for him. He wanted to spend more time sitting with and devising a 
                    character as well as play a variety of roles, so he chose to transition into film and not accept any more 
                    television work.<br>

                <ul>
                    Aged 19, Gosling decided to move into "serious acting" and he said quote "It's time to get my Gosling on". He was dropped by his fake as hell agent and initially found it 
                    difficult to secure work because of the "stigma" attached to children's television. After a supporting 
                    role in the football drama Remember the Titans, he secured a lead role as a young Jewish neo-Nazi in 2001's 
                    The Believer. Director Henry Bean said he cast Gosling because his Mormon upbringing helped him understand 
                    the isolation of Judaism. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised an "electrifying and terrifyingly 
                    convincing" performance while Todd McCarthy of Variety felt his "dynamite performance" could "scarcely 
                    have been better". The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival and Gosling has 
                    described it as "the film that kind of gift-wrapped for me the career that I have now." Because of the 
                    controversial nature of the film, it was difficult to secure financial backing for a full theatrical release,
                    [38] and the film was instead broadcast on Showtime. The film was a commercial failure, grossing $416,925 
                    worldwide from a production budget of $1.5 million.<br>
                    <br>

                    In 2003, Gosling starred in The United States of Leland as a teenager imprisoned for the murder of a disabled boy. 
                    He was drawn to the role because it was unusual to find a character that was "emotionally disconnected for the whole 
                    film."[48] Critic Roger Ebert felt that the "gifted actor does everything that can be done with Leland, but the 
                    character comes from a writer's conceits, not from life."[49] A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted that he 
                    "struggles to rescue Leland from the clutches of cliché"[50] while David Rooney of Variety felt that his "one-note, 
                    blankly disturbed act has none of the magnetic edge of his breakthrough work in The Believer".[51] The film grossed 
                    $343,847 in the United States and was not released overseas.

        Gosling previously resided in New York City.
        He co-owns Tagine, a Moroccan restaurant in Beverly Hills, California.
         He bought the restaurant on an impulse; he said he spent "all [his] money" on it, spent a year doing the 
         renovation work himself, and now oversees the restaurant's menus.<br>
         <br>

         Gosling created hit indie game <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/artist/66uU7VPJQ8eC06LAZyqYYk?si=I3abOku-Q_u44l4zmgQcpQ">"Five Nights at Freddy's</a> 
         and published it in 2014. He then created many more sequels in the years to come, and Scott Cawthon is actually Ryan Gosling.
         This is all true and not misinformation as this is a wikipedia page. <br> 
         <br>

         He is a big woman supporter, He loves his mom, wife and daughter so much he is the biggest women supporter known to man. He 
         also loves dogs a canine connoisseur, as in he likes them a lot just like many other people. <br>
         <br>

         Gosling actually tatooed his left arm all by himself, talk about a talented individual. Ryan Gosling may just be everyone famous
         and everyone that you know, he may as well be living with you at this point and that's awesome because Gosling is so cool and maybe the 
         best person to ever have walked the earth, hell maybe you are Gosling himself.
